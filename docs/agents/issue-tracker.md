# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues on `realroboto/meta-graph-cli`. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations (`gh` infers the repo from `git remote -v` inside the clone).

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` / `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

## Cross-repo: the consumer is private

The consumer of this package is [`realroboto/vmCODE`](https://github.com/realroboto/vmCODE), which is **private** while this repo is **public**. Two consequences:

- `gh issue transfer` between them fails (`Old issue cannot be transferred from private repository to public repository`). To move work across, recreate the issue and close the original as a pointer.
- Cross-references render as bare `realroboto/vmCODE#N` for anyone without access. Spell out what the linked issue does rather than relying on the title preview.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo starts treating external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (`gh api` on the sub-issues endpoint). Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies**. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>` line at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop any with an open blocker (`issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by > 0`) or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`, the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
